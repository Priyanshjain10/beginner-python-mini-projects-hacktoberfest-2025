# Project Description

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built in Python using the random module. The program allows the user to play against the computer in a continuous loop until they decide to quit. The player is prompted to enter either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors", while the computer randomly selects its own move using random.randint(0, 2) — where 0 represents Rock, 1 represents Scissors, and 2 represents Paper. The game then compares both choices and prints the result, declaring whether it’s a win, loss, or draw. For example, Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both the player and computer choose the same option, the result is a draw. The loop continues to prompt for new input, making it an interactive and beginner-friendly terminal-based project. Players can exit anytime by typing "quit", which gracefully ends the game.

# How to run the project

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
